# Cron Diagnosis for Vercel Pro Account

Since you're on Vercel Pro, the issue ISN'T the cron limit. Let's find the real problem.

## Step 1: Verify Crons Are Registered

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `ownerfi` project
3. Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Crons**
4. You should see a list of all registered crons

**What to check:**
- Are all 9 crons listed?
- Do they show "Last Run" timestamps?
- Are any showing errors?

**If crons are missing:** Your `vercel.json` might not be properly deployed.

---

## Step 2: Check Cron Schedule Issue

Your current schedule: `"0 9-23/2 * * *"`

This means: **"Only run between 9 AM - 11 PM"**

**Current time check:**
```bash
date
# If it's between midnight-9am or 11pm-midnight, crons WON'T run!
```

**Quick test - check what time it is in your server's timezone:**
```bash
curl -s https://ownerfi.ai/api/time 2>/dev/null || echo "Check current server time"
```

If it's currently outside 9 AM - 11 PM, that could explain why they haven't run recently!

---

## Step 3: Test Endpoints Manually

Let's verify the endpoints actually work:

```bash
# Get your CRON_SECRET from Vercel
# Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables ‚Üí CRON_SECRET

export CRON_SECRET="your_secret_here"

# Test the most critical failsafe (the new one I built)
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/check-stuck-posting \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected responses:**
- ‚úÖ `200` with JSON - Endpoint works, will fix stuck workflows
- ‚ùå `401` - Wrong CRON_SECRET
- ‚ùå `404` - Endpoint not deployed
- ‚ùå `500` - Server error (check logs)

---

## Step 4: Check Recent Deployments

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí **Deployments**
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the **Build Logs** for errors
4. Verify `vercel.json` changes were included

**Key things to verify:**
- Was the latest code pushed to `main` branch?
- Did the deployment succeed?
- Are there any build warnings about `vercel.json`?

---

## Step 5: Check Vercel Function Logs

1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí **Logs** tab
2. Filter by: `/api/cron`
3. Look for recent executions

**What to look for:**
```
# Good - crons are running
üîç [FAILSAFE] Checking for stuck Submagic workflows...

# Bad - no logs at all
(silence means crons aren't triggering)
```

---

## Most Likely Causes (Pro Account):

### 1. **Schedule Timing Issue** ‚è∞
Your crons only run 9 AM - 11 PM. If you checked at 2 AM, they won't have run.

**Fix:** Change schedule to 24/7:
```json
"schedule": "0 */2 * * *"  // Every 2 hours, 24/7
```

### 2. **Deployment Not Complete** üöÄ
The new `/api/cron/check-stuck-posting` endpoint might not be deployed yet.

**Fix:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add posting failsafe and fix cron schedules"
git push origin main
```

### 3. **CRON_SECRET Missing** üîë
Even if crons trigger, they'll fail with 401 if secret is wrong.

**Fix:** Verify in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

### 4. **Crons Disabled** üî¥
Even on Pro, crons can be manually disabled.

**Fix:** Go to Settings ‚Üí Crons ‚Üí Check if toggle is ON for each cron

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these to get immediate answers:

```bash
# 1. Check if endpoint exists
curl -I https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/check-stuck-posting

# 2. Test with auth (replace with your secret)
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/check-stuck-posting \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  -v

# 3. Check Vercel cron list via CLI
npx vercel crons list --token your_vercel_token
```

---

## Immediate Action Items

**Do this right now to fix your stuck workflows:**

1. **Get CRON_SECRET from Vercel Dashboard**

2. **Run manual fixes:**
```bash
export CRON_SECRET="your_secret"

# Fix workflows stuck in Posting (41h, 43h)
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/check-stuck-posting \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Fix workflows stuck in Submagic Processing (2h, 20h)
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/check-stuck-submagic \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

3. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Crons
   - Screenshot what you see
   - Share with me if you need help interpreting

## What's Your Next Step?

Tell me what you see in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Crons:

- [ ] I see all 9 crons listed
- [ ] I only see some crons listed
- [ ] I don't see the Crons tab at all
- [ ] Crons are listed but showing errors
- [ ] Crons show "Last Run" was recent
- [ ] Crons show "Last Run" was never or very old

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!
