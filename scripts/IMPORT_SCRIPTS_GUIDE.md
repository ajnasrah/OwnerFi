# Import Scripts Guide

## Two Scripts - Different Use Cases

### üöÄ `import-json-to-firebase.ts` (FAST - Use This!)

**When to use:**
- You already have scraped Apify JSON data
- You want to import quickly (seconds, not minutes)

**Speed:** **50 properties in ~3 seconds** ‚ö°

**What it does:**
1. Reads your Apify JSON file
2. Validates & transforms data
3. Imports directly to Firebase
4. **NO API calls, NO delays**

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-json-to-firebase.ts /path/to/apify-data.json
```

**Example:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-json-to-firebase.ts ~/Downloads/dataset_zillow-detail-scraper_2025-10-21_15-41-24-538.json
```

### üêå `import-to-firebase.ts` (SLOW - Don't Use)

**When to use:**
- You have a CSV/Excel with Zillow URLs (not scraped data)
- You need to scrape the data first

**Speed:** **Minutes per batch** (calls Apify API + delays)

**What it does:**
1. Reads URLs from CSV/Excel
2. **Sends URLs to Apify to scrape** (SLOW!)
3. Waits for Apify to finish
4. Then imports to Firebase

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-to-firebase.ts
```
