# âœ… AUTOMATED AMORTIZATION - COMPLETE

## What's Now Automated

**ALL property creation paths now automatically calculate term years based on price:**

### 1. âœ… GHL Webhook (Properties from GoHighLevel)
**File:** `/src/app/api/gohighlevel/webhook/save-property/route.ts`
- Automatically applies dynamic term years when properties come from GHL
- Only recalculates monthly payment if interest rate is provided (not for pre-filled payments)

### 2. âœ… Admin Property Creation API
**File:** `/src/app/api/admin/properties/create/route.ts`
- Uses `calculatePropertyFinancials()` to auto-calculate all financial fields
- `termYears` is now optional - calculated automatically if not provided
- Respects manual overrides if explicitly provided

### 3. âœ… Property Calculations Library
**File:** `/src/lib/property-calculations.ts`
- Core logic: `getDefaultTermYears(listPrice)`
- Applied everywhere that uses `calculatePropertyFinancials()`

### 4. âœ… Existing Properties Updated
**Script:** `/scripts/update-property-terms.ts`
- **242 properties updated** with new term years
- **266 properties skipped** (pre-filled or already correct)
- **0 errors**

## Automation Rules

```
Price < $150k     â†’ 15 years
Price $150k-300k  â†’ 20 years
Price $300k-600k  â†’ 25 years
Price $600k+      â†’ 30 years
```

**Example:**
- $120k house â†’ 15 yr â†’ Higher monthly payment (pays off faster)
- $280k house â†’ 20 yr â†’ Standard term
- $450k house â†’ 25 yr â†’ Lower monthly payment
- $850k house â†’ 30 yr â†’ Lowest monthly payment

## What Happens Automatically

### New Property from GHL:
1. Property webhook receives data
2. If `termYears` not provided â†’ **AUTO-CALCULATED** based on price
3. If `interestRate` provided â†’ monthly payment **AUTO-CALCULATED** using new term
4. If `monthlyPayment` pre-filled â†’ **PRESERVED** (not recalculated)
5. Saved to Firestore with correct term years

### New Property from Admin:
1. Admin enters property data
2. API calls `calculatePropertyFinancials()`
3. Term years **AUTO-CALCULATED** based on price
4. Monthly payment **AUTO-CALCULATED** if interest rate provided
5. Saved with correct financials

### Property Edit:
1. Admin opens edit form
2. Current `termYears` displayed in new field
3. Can override manually or leave blank for auto-calculation
4. When price/interest/down payment changes â†’ **AUTO-RECALCULATES**

---

## Manual Override Still Works

**If you want to force a specific term:**
1. Edit property in admin
2. Set "Amortization Term Years" field to desired value
3. Save - will use your value instead of auto-calculation

**To reset to auto:**
1. Clear the "Amortization Term Years" field (leave blank)
2. Save - will recalculate based on price

## Files Modified

### Core Logic:
1. `/src/lib/property-calculations.ts` - Added `getDefaultTermYears()`
2. `/src/app/api/gohighlevel/webhook/save-property/route.ts` - Uses dynamic terms
3. `/src/app/api/admin/properties/create/route.ts` - Auto-calculates on create
4. `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added term years field to edit form

### Scripts:
1. `/scripts/update-property-terms.ts` - One-time update of existing properties
2. `/scripts/test-amortization.ts` - Verification tests

---

## Verification

### Test the automation:
```bash
# Test the calculation logic
npx tsx scripts/test-amortization.ts

# Create a new property via API - termYears will be auto-set
# Edit a property in admin - you'll see the term years field
# Import from GHL - term years calculated automatically
```

### Check a specific property:
```bash
# In Firestore console, check any property
# Look for termYears field - should match price range
```

---

## What Users See

### Buyers:
- More affordable monthly payments on expensive homes (longer terms)
- Realistic payments that match property price points
- No change to how they browse/swipe

### Admin:
- New "Amortization Term Years" field in edit form
- Shows auto-calculated value or can override
- Helper text explains the rules

### Sellers/Realtors:
- Properties automatically get appropriate terms
- No manual calculation needed
- Can still override if needed

## Impact on Monthly Payments

### Compared to old 20-year default:

**$120k house:**
- Was: $1,041/mo (20 yr)
- Now: $1,159/mo (15 yr)
- Change: +$118/mo (shorter term)

**$450k house:**
- Was: $2,902/mo (20 yr)
- Now: $2,609/mo (25 yr)
- Change: -$293/mo (longer term) ðŸ’°

**$850k house:**
- Was: $5,475/mo (20 yr est)
- Now: $4,492/mo (30 yr)
- Change: -$983/mo (much longer term) ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

## âœ… Status: FULLY AUTOMATED

**No manual intervention required. All new properties will automatically:**
- Calculate correct term years based on price
- Calculate correct monthly payments
- Save with proper financials
- Display correctly in UI

**Existing properties: Already updated (ran script on all 508 properties)**
