# OwnerFi Homepage Redesign Plan
**Target Audience:** 25-40 year old renters looking to buy their first home
**Core Problem to Solve:** Users think this is a static landing page/scam, not a legitimate interactive web application

---

## üéØ Primary Goals

1. **Show it's a REAL web app** - Not just a landing page with forms
2. **Build trust & credibility** - Prove this isn't a scam
3. **Demonstrate the interactive experience** - Show the swiping functionality upfront
4. **Convert renters to homebuyers** - Make them feel this is achievable

---

## üé® Design Strategy

### Current Problems:
- Homepage looks like every other "owner financing" landing page
- No visual proof of the interactive app experience
- Lacks social proof and credibility indicators
- Doesn't differentiate from competitors
- Too much text, not enough showing the product

### Solution Approach:
Make it clear this is **"Tinder for Houses"** - a modern, interactive web application

## ‚ùì Questions for Feedback

1. Is the "Swipe Your Way Into Your Dream Home" headline too clever or perfect?
2. Should we show MORE of the actual app (multiple screenshots)?
3. Is 3 testimonials enough or should we show more?
4. Should we add a "How is this different from Zillow/Realtor?" section?
5. Do we need more trust badges (BBB, security certs, etc.)?
6. Should we add a FAQ section addressing "Is this a scam?" directly?
7. Is the phone mockup enough or do we need an embedded demo?
8. Should we add more about the company/team (About Us section)?
9. Is the dark theme appropriate or should we test light theme?
