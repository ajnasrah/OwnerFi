# Benefit Video Circle Style Fix ✅

## Issue
Benefit videos were showing avatar in a circle with green background instead of filling the whole screen (square/full-screen style).

## Root Cause
The `talking_photo_style` was set to `'circle'` in the benefit video generator, causing the avatar to appear in a circular frame with visible background color.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `src/lib/benefit-video-generator.ts:165`

### Before:
```typescript
character: {
  type: 'talking_photo',
  talking_photo_id: AVATAR_CONFIG.talking_photo_id,
  scale: AVATAR_CONFIG.scale,
  talking_photo_style: 'circle' // ❌ WRONG - causes circle avatar
},
```

### After:
```typescript
character: {
  type: 'talking_photo',
  talking_photo_id: AVATAR_CONFIG.talking_photo_id,
  scale: AVATAR_CONFIG.scale,
  talking_photo_style: 'square', // ✅ CORRECT - full screen
  talking_style: 'expressive' // ✅ Added for motion
},
```

## All Brand Styles Verified

| Brand | Style | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Carz** (Viral) | `square` | ✅ Correct |
| **OwnerFi** (Viral) | `square` | ✅ Correct |
| **VassDistro** (Viral) | `square` | ✅ Correct |
| **Benefit** | `square` | ✅ **FIXED** |
| **Podcast** | `square` | ✅ Correct |
| **Property** | `circle` | ✅ Correct (intentional) |

### Why Property Uses Circle?
Property videos are designed to show the property image as the background, with the avatar in a small circle in the corner. This is intentional and should NOT be changed.

## Files Checked

1. ✅ `src/lib/benefit-video-generator.ts` - FIXED
2. ✅ `src/app/api/workflow/complete-viral/route.ts` - Already correct
3. ✅ `src/app/api/podcast/cron/route.ts` - Already correct
4. ✅ `podcast/lib/heygen-podcast.ts` - Already correct
5. ✅ `src/lib/property-video-generator.ts` - Correctly using circle

## Workflow History "Issue" - Not Actually an Issue

The screenshot showed a benefit workflow in "Heygen Processing" status under "Active Only" view, which is **correct behavior**!

### Workflow Status Flow:
1. `heygen_processing` - Video generating with HeyGen (shows in Active)
2. `submagic_processing` - Adding captions with Submagic (shows in Active)
3. `posting` - Posting to social media via Late API (shows in Active)
4. `completed` - Fully complete (shows in History only)

### Active Statuses (in `/api/benefit/workflow/logs`):
```typescript
const activeStatuses = [
  'heygen_processing',
  'submagic_processing',
  'video_processing',
  'posting'
];
```

The workflow WAS correctly showing in the Active view because it was still `heygen_processing`. Once it completes all steps and reaches `completed` status, it will move to History.

## Testing

### Generate New Benefit Video
```bash
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/benefit/cron \
  -H "authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### Expected Result
- Avatar fills entire screen (no circle)
- Green background behind avatar
- Motion/gestures visible
- Full-screen professional appearance

### Compare With Property Video
Property videos should still show:
- Small circular avatar in corner
- Property image as background
- Avatar doesn't fill screen

## Next Benefit Video
The next benefit video generated will have:
- ✅ Full-screen square avatar (not circle)
- ✅ Motion-enabled avatar with gestures
- ✅ Expressive talking style
- ✅ Professional full-screen appearance

**Fix Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Impact**: Future benefit videos will use correct full-screen style
**Note**: Old videos in queue will keep circle style (generated before fix)
