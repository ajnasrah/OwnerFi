## üìä Viral Metrics to Track

### What Makes a Script "Gangster"?

**Hook Test** (First 3 seconds):
- Would YOU stop scrolling?
- Does it create confusion/curiosity?
- Is there a clear "enemy" or problem?

**Value Test** (Middle):
- Is there ONE clear takeaway?
- Can someone explain it to a friend?
- Does it feel like insider knowledge?

**Share Test** (End):
- Would someone tag a friend?
- Is there social proof/validation?
- Does it end with empowerment?

### A/B Testing Framework

**Test These Variables:**
1. Hook type (shock vs curiosity vs pain)
2. Villain (bank vs dealer vs landlord)
3. CTA type (follow vs save vs share)
4. Caption length (1 vs 2 vs 3 sentences)
5. Emoji density (none vs moderate vs heavy)

**Winning Patterns:**
- Controversy + Proof = Shares
- Secret + Number = Saves
- Hook + Value + CTA = Follows

## üöÄ Advanced Tactics

### Psychological Triggers

**Loss Aversion:**
"You're losing $X every [timeframe]..."
‚Üí People fear loss 2x more than they value gain

**Social Proof:**
"X people just did this..."
‚Üí FOMO + validation = action

**Authority:**
"After X years, here's what I know..."
‚Üí Credibility = trust

**Scarcity:**
"This only works until [date/event]..."
‚Üí Urgency = immediate action

**Reciprocity:**
"I'm giving you this for free because..."
‚Üí Free value = loyalty

### Engagement Bait (Use Sparingly)

**Comment Magnet:**
"Drop a üî• if you knew this already..."
"Tell me in the comments which one shocked you..."

**Save Trigger:**
"Screenshot this before it's gone..."
"You'll need this later. Save it now..."

**Share Hook:**
"Tag someone who needs to see this..."
"Send this to someone buying a [car/house]..."
