## Next Steps

The easiest solution is **Option 2**: Simply delete these failed workflows and let the system retry them:

```bash
# The RSS articles are still locked to these workflows
# Deleting the workflows will free up the articles
# Then run the normal workflow pipeline with your new Submagic credits
```

Your Submagic credits are working now, so future workflows will process normally!
