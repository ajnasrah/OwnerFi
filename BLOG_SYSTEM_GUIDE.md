## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access the Admin

Visit: `https://your-domain.com/admin/blog`

### Step 2: Create Your First Blog

1. Click **"+ Create New Post"**
2. Select **Brand** (OwnerFi, Carz Inc, Abdullah, or Vass Distro)
3. Choose **Content Pillar** (e.g., "Owner Finance 101")
4. Fill in:
   - **Title** (e.g., "How to Buy a House With Bad Credit Using Owner Financing in Dallas")
   - **Subtitle** (optional)
   - **Author** (e.g., "OwnerFi Team" or "Abdullah")
   - **Focus Keyword** (e.g., "owner financing bad credit")
   - **Tags** (e.g., "owner finance, real estate, texas")

5. **Fill in the 6 sections:**

   **Section 1 - Hook (Introduction)**
   - Write 3-5 sentences that grab attention
   - Example: "Want to buy a house but have bad credit? You're not alone. Over 30% of Americans have credit scores below 650. Owner financing might be your solution. Here's exactly how it works in Dallas."

   **Section 2 - Problem (The Challenge)**
   - Explain the situation in simple terms
   - Example: "Traditional bank loans require credit scores of 620+. If yours is lower, you'll get rejected. But seller financing doesn't have those requirements."

   **Section 3 - Steps (How It Works)** ← THIS BECOMES YOUR CAROUSEL
   - Add 3-7 bullet points (each bullet = 1 slide)
   - Example bullets:
     - "Find a seller willing to finance (we list these on OwnerFi.ai)"
     - "Negotiate down payment (typically $10k-$30k in Dallas)"
     - "Agree on interest rate and monthly payment"
     - "Close with a title company (required in Texas)"
     - "Make monthly payments directly to seller for 3-7 years"
     - "Refinance with a bank once your credit improves"

   **Section 4 - Example (Real Story)**
   - Share a real case with numbers
   - Example: "$245,000 house in Dallas. $15,000 down. 9% interest. $1,950/month. 5-year balloon. Buyer had 580 credit score."

   **Section 5 - FAQ (Common Questions)**
   - Answer 3-5 questions
   - Example: "What if I can't refinance in 5 years? You can negotiate an extension with the seller or sell the property."

   **Section 6 - CTA (Next Steps)**
   - Clear call to action
   - Example: "Visit OwnerFi.ai to see owner financed properties in Dallas, Houston, and Austin. Filter by down payment and monthly payment."

6. Choose **"Publish Now"** or **"Save as Draft"**

7. Click **"Publish Blog"**

### Step 3: View Your Blog

Visit: `https://your-domain.com/ownerfi/blog` (or `/carz/blog`, `/abdullah/blog`)

Your blog is live with:
- ✅ Perfect SEO (meta tags, schema markup)
- ✅ Auto-generated OG image for Facebook/Twitter
- ✅ Social sharing buttons
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Getting the Social Images

### Option 1: Use the Auto-Generated URLs

After creating a blog, the system generates image URLs like:
```
/api/og?type=carousel-slide&brand=ownerfi&title=Step 1&content=Find a seller...&slide=1&total=7
```

**To download:**
1. Right-click the image preview
2. "Save image as..."
3. Upload to Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn

### Option 2: Programmatic Download (Coming Soon)

I can add a button in the admin to download all social images as a ZIP file.
