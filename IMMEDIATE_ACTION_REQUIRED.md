# IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Fix Viral Videos

## Current Status
‚ùå **All viral video workflows failing with "No articles available"**

**Root Cause**: 70% of your RSS feeds are broken or provide zero content.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION (Follow These Steps)

### Step 1: Clean Up Database (Run This Now)

```bash
npx tsx scripts/cleanup-empty-articles.ts
```

This removes all articles with 0 content from your database.

---

### Step 2: Disable Broken Feeds

**OwnerFi has 28 feeds total:**
- ‚úÖ 9 feeds work perfectly (3000-9000 chars each)
- ‚ùå 19 feeds are broken (need to disable)

**Option A (Quick):** Temporarily disable ALL OwnerFi feeds except these 9:

In `src/config/feed-sources.ts`, keep ONLY these feeds enabled:

```typescript
'ownerfi-housingwire'          // HousingWire - Housing Market News
'ownerfi-realtor-news'         // Realtor.com - News & Insights
'ownerfi-zillow-research'      // Zillow - Research & Insights
'ownerfi-redfin-news'          // Redfin - Real Estate News
'ownerfi-theclose'             // The Close - Real Estate News
'ownerfi-housingwire-realestate'  // HousingWire - Real Estate
'ownerfi-housingwire-mortgages'   // HousingWire - Mortgages
'ownerfi-familyhandyman'       // Family Handyman
'ownerfi-homeadvisor-blog'     // HomeAdvisor - Home Tips
```

**Set `enabled: false` for all others.**

**Option B (Complete Removal):** Delete the 19 broken feeds entirely from the file.

---

### Step 3: Fetch Fresh Articles

```bash
curl -X GET https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/fetch-feeds
```

**Expected**: Should fetch 25-30 new articles with FULL content.

---

### Step 4: Rate Articles

```bash
curl -X GET https://ownerfi.ai/api/cron/rate-articles
```

**Expected**: Articles rated 0-100 based on 30-year-old audience criteria.

---

### Step 5: Test Workflow

```bash
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/workflow/complete-viral \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "ownerfi",
    "platforms": ["instagram", "tiktok"],
    "schedule": "optimal"
  }'
```

**Expected**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS! Video generation starts.
