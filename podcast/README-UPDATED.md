## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

```bash
# Test script generation with new energy
node podcast/tests/test-script-generation.js

# Generate complete episode (optimized workflow)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/podcast/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"questionsCount": 5, "autoPublish": false}'
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

git add .
git commit -m "Optimize podcast system"
git push origin main
```

Cron job will run automatically every Monday at 9 AM!

## Architecture

### Old Way (❌ EXPENSIVE)
```
1. Generate Script → $0.01
2. Generate Q1 video → $0.54
3. Generate A1 video → $0.54
4. Generate Q2 video → $0.54

Total: ~$5.40 per episode
```

### New Way (✅ OPTIMIZED)
```
1. Generate Script → $0.01

## API Routes

### Generate Episode
```bash
POST /api/podcast/generate

Body:
{
  "guestId": "doctor",          # Optional: specific guest
  "questionsCount": 5,           # Default: 5
  "autoPublish": true,           # Default: true
  "brand": "ownerfi"             # Default: ownerfi
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "episode_number": 2,
  "episode_title": "Dr. Smith on Nutrition and Diet",
  "guest_name": "Dr. Smith",
  "video_url": "https://...",
  "clips_count": 10,
  "published": true
}
```

### Cron Trigger (Weekly)
```bash
GET /api/podcast/cron
Authorization: Bearer {CRON_SECRET}

# Runs automatically via Vercel Cron
# Schedule: 0 9 * * 1 (Every Monday at 9 AM)
```

## Cost Tracking

View your spending:

```bash
# In your API route logs:
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              PODCAST COST REPORT                       ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📊 Total Episodes Generated: 5
💰 Total Cost: $5.25
📈 Average per Episode: $1.05
📅 Last 30 Days: $3.15

💵 Cost Breakdown by Service:

   openai      : $0.05
   heygen      : $2.70
   submagic    : $2.50
```

## Error Recovery

If generation fails mid-process:

1. **Checkpoint saved** - Progress preserved
2. **Auto-retry** - Up to 3 attempts
3. **Resume from failure point** - Don't re-do expensive steps

View incomplete episodes:
```typescript
const checkpoint = new CheckpointManager();
const incomplete = checkpoint.getIncompleteEpisodes();
console.log(incomplete); // Shows what failed and where
```

## Script Energy Examples

### Before (Boring)
```
Q: What's the most important factor in preventing cardiovascular disease?
A: Regular cardiovascular exercise is crucial. Just 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week can significantly reduce your risk.
```

### After (EXPLOSIVE)
```
Q: Wait, so what's the BIGGEST mistake people make with their heart health?
A: Okay listen - they sit all day! Your body needs to MOVE. Just 30 minutes of walking every single day can literally add YEARS to your life. Most people don't realize how simple it is!
```

## Publishing Strategy

### Long-Form (3-5 min full episode)
- YouTube (main channel)
- Facebook Video

### Short-Form (30-60s clips)
- Instagram Reels
- Facebook Reels
- YouTube Shorts
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- Threads

All posted automatically via Metricool!

## Monitoring

### View Logs
```bash
# Cost logs
cat podcast/logs/cost-log.jsonl

# Checkpoints (if errors occurred)
ls podcast/checkpoints/

# Episode metadata
cat podcast/output/episode-*/metadata.json
```

### Scheduler Stats
```typescript
const scheduler = new PodcastScheduler();
const stats = scheduler.getStats();

// {
//   total_episodes: 5,
//   published_episodes: 4,
//   recent_guests: ['doctor', 'financial_advisor'],
//   schedule_enabled: true
// }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Episode Generation Fails
- Check checkpoint: `podcast/checkpoints/episode-X.json`
- View error in checkpoint.error field
- Manually retry or wait for auto-retry

### Cron Not Running
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify CRON_SECRET is set
- Check vercel.json has cron config

### Publishing Fails
- Verify Metricool API keys
- Check brand ID is correct
- View error in API response

### High Costs
- Check cost-log.jsonl for unexpected charges
- Verify using single API call (not old multi-call method)
- Review HeyGen video duration

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All systems operational
2. Test manual generation: `POST /api/podcast/generate`
3. Wait for Monday cron or trigger manually
4. Monitor costs in logs
5. Review published content on social media

## Support
