          <p>
            Owner financing is when the person selling a house acts like a bank. Instead of you getting a loan from a bank to buy their house,
            the seller lets you pay them directly over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like buying a car from a friend. Instead of paying your friend all the money upfront,
            they might let you pay them $300 every month until you've paid the full price. Owner financing works the same way with houses.
