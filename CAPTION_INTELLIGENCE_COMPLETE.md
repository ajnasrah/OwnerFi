const scriptContent = await generateViralContent(article.content, brand);
const captionData = await generateCaptionAndComment({
  topic: article.title,
  brand: brand,
  script: scriptContent.script,
  platform: 'both'
});

const content = {
  script: scriptContent.script,
  title: scriptContent.title,

  firstComment: captionData.firstComment
};
```
