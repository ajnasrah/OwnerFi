### FACEBOOK (Low Confidence - Data Quality Issues)
**Critical Issue: NO view/reach/impression data - 7.4% data coverage ⚠️**

| Day | Time | Engagement* | Avg Interactions** | Confidence |
|-----|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Sunday** | 9:00 AM | N/A | 2.00 | 🔴 Low (1 post) |
| **Monday** | 6:00 AM | N/A | 2.67 | 🟡 Medium (3 posts) |

*_Cannot calculate engagement rate without view data_
**_Based only on likes + comments + shares (no views/reach/impressions available)_

**⚠️ CRITICAL DATA LIMITATIONS:**
- **0 posts** have view/reach/impression data (100% missing)
- Only **32 out of 432 posts** (7.4%) have ANY engagement data
- **All 432 posts show 0 views, 0 reach, 0 impressions**
- Engagement exists (likes/comments/shares) but no viewership metrics
- Cannot calculate true engagement rates

**Top Performing Times (by raw interactions only):**
1. **6:00 AM** - 2.41 avg interactions (17 posts) - Most reliable
2. **6:00 PM** - 6.00 avg interactions (1 post) - Highest but unreliable
3. **9:00 AM** - 2.00 avg interactions (1 post)

**Key Insights:**
- **6:00 AM is most consistent** across weekdays (Mon-Sat)
- Tuesday 6:00 PM had highest interactions (6) but only 1 post
- Thursday shows best average engagement (2.67 interactions)
- GetLate API is **not receiving viewership data from Facebook**

**🚨 CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. **Verify Facebook Graph API integration** - Check if GetLate has proper access
2. **Check permissions** - Ensure access token has `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_user_content`
3. **Investigate API limitation** - Facebook may not be sharing view/reach data with GetLate
4. **Contact GetLate Support** - Ask why Facebook viewership metrics are missing
5. **Alternative:** Use **Meta Business Suite** for accurate Facebook analytics
6. **Consider deprioritizing Facebook** until analytics are fixed

**⚠️ These recommendations are UNRELIABLE - Use with extreme caution**
