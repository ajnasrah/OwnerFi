    {
      question: "What is owner financing?",
      answer: "Owner financing is when the person selling a house acts like a bank. Instead of you getting a loan from a bank to buy their house, the seller lets you pay them directly over time. The seller becomes your lender and you make monthly payments to them instead of a traditional mortgage company."
    },
    {
      question: "How is owner financing different from a bank loan?",
      answer: "With owner financing, the seller determines credit requirements, potentially has less paperwork, may close faster, and owns the loan directly. Traditional bank loans have strict credit score requirements, extensive paperwork, take 30-45 days to close, and the bank owns the loan."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the 4 main types of alternative financing?",
      answer: "The 4 main types are: 1) Seller Finance - seller owns house outright, you get deed immediately. 2) Subject To - you take over existing mortgage payments. 3) Contract for Deed - you don't get deed until fully paid. 4) Lease-to-Own - you rent with option to buy later."
    },
    {
      question: "Why would sellers offer owner financing?",
      answer: "Sellers offer owner financing to earn interest income over time, sell their property faster by expanding the buyer pool, gain potential tax advantages, and create a steady investment income stream for retirement."
    },
    {
      question: "What are balloon payments in owner financing?",
      answer: "A balloon payment is when you make regular monthly payments for a set period (like 5 years), then must pay off the remaining balance. This gives you time to build equity and improve your credit to refinance with a traditional lender."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to pay property taxes and insurance separately with owner financing?",
      answer: "Yes, unlike bank loans, owner financing typically doesn't include an escrow account. You must pay property taxes directly to the county, arrange and pay for home insurance yourself, and pay any HOA fees directly."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of owner financing for buyers?",
      answer: "Key risks include: seller might still owe money on the house, property might have hidden problems, varying interest rates, different legal protections than bank loans, and the seller's right to perform credit checks and income verification."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I protect myself in an owner finance deal?",
      answer: "Protect yourself by hiring a licensed real estate agent, using a title company or attorney, getting everything in writing, conducting a professional property inspection, purchasing title insurance, and consulting with professionals before signing anything."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get owner financing with bad credit?",
      answer: "Owner financing may be more flexible than traditional bank loans regarding credit. Each seller sets their own requirements. While some sellers may work with buyers with poor credit, they may require larger down payments or higher interest rates."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I can't make a balloon payment when it's due?",
      answer: "Your options include refinancing with a bank using built equity, selling the property, paying the balance if you have funds available, or negotiating with the seller for an extension. Start planning for the balloon payment well in advance."
