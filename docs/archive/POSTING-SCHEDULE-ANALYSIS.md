## üìä A/B Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline (Weeks 1-2)
Keep current schedule, track metrics:
- Likes per post (by time slot)
- Comments per post
- Shares per post
- Views/Reach per post
- Click-through rate (if applicable)

### Phase 2: Test Optimized Schedule (Weeks 3-4)
Implement Option A, track same metrics

### Phase 3: Analysis (Week 5)
Compare:
- Average engagement per slot
- Best performing time
- Worst performing time
- Platform-specific patterns

### Tools for Tracking
Since GetLate doesn't have analytics API yet:
1. **Manual**: Weekly spreadsheet logging
2. **Platform Native**: Instagram Insights, TikTok Analytics, etc.
3. **Screenshot Dashboard**: Daily GetLate dashboard screenshots

## üîÑ Dynamic Adjustment

Based on data after 4 weeks:
1. Replace worst-performing slot with +1 hour from best
2. Test for 2 weeks
3. Repeat until optimal schedule found

## üí° Additional Recommendations

### 1. Weekend vs Weekday
Consider different schedules:
- **Weekday**: 9AM, 12PM, 3PM, 6PM, 8PM
- **Weekend**: 10AM, 1PM, 4PM, 7PM, 9PM (people wake/scroll later)

### 2. Seasonal Adjustment
- **Summer** (June-Aug): Shift +1 hour later (outdoor activities delay scrolling)
- **Winter** (Nov-Feb): Current schedule optimal (more indoor time)

### 3. Daylight Saving
Remember to account for DST transitions in ET!

## üìà Expected Results Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Establish baseline
- **Week 3-4**: Test optimization
- **Week 5**: Analyze and adjust
- **Week 6-8**: Fine-tune based on data
- **Week 9+**: Locked optimal schedule

## Implementation

To update schedule, edit `src/lib/feed-store-firestore.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 870
const POSTING_SCHEDULE_HOURS = [9, 12, 15, 18, 20]; // Updated schedule
```

Then redeploy to Vercel.

---

**Next Action**: Track engagement for 2 weeks with current schedule, then implement Option A for comparison.
