**Caption Formula:**
```
[Direct personal statement or pain point question] [200-300 character story with specific numbers and relatable details] #homeowner #rent #badcredit #ownerfinance #realestate
```

**Example:**
```
This is how I bought this house with a 550 credit score and self employed income

Banks rejected me 3 times. Traditional lenders said no. But owner financing said YES. I found a seller willing to work directly with me - no bank needed. Now I pay $1,200/month building equity instead of $1,500 in rent. Bad credit doesn't mean you can't own a home. #homeowner #rent #badcredit #ownerfinance #realestateinvesting #creditrepair

## üîÑ CROSS-PLATFORM VIDEO EDITING STRATEGY

### Same Video, Different Edits for Each Platform

Since you're creating video content that goes to multiple platforms, here's how to edit the SAME core video differently:

#### Step 1: Core Video Creation
1. Shoot/generate your base video content
2. Have both news/announcement angle AND personal story angle in the script
3. Include B-roll, text overlays, and specific numbers

#### Step 2: Platform-Specific Editing

**YouTube Edit:**
- **Hook**: Start with most shocking moment
- **Text Overlay**: "[Emoji] BREAKING: [Headline]!"
- **Pacing**: Fast cuts, news-style
- **Angle**: News/announcement perspective
- **Length**: 30-60 seconds
- **Export**: 9:16 vertical

**Instagram Edit:**
- **Hook**: Start with personal story moment
- **Text Overlay**: "This is how I..." or "Are you tired of..."
- **Pacing**: Slower, let story breathe
- **Angle**: Personal story/pain point perspective
- **Length**: 45-90 seconds (can be longer)
- **Export**: 9:16 vertical

#### Step 3: Platform-Specific Captions

**YouTube Caption:**
```
[Emoji] [NEWS HEADLINE]!

[Question hook]

[200-300 chars news angle with stats]

#Hashtags #News #Topic
```

**Instagram Caption:**
```
[Personal story opening or pain point question]

[200-300 chars personal narrative with specific numbers]

#homeowner #rent #badcredit #ownerfinance #realestate #creditrepair
```

## üéØ CONTENT TOPIC MATRIX BY PLATFORM

| Video Topic | YouTube Angle | Instagram Angle |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **EV News** | "üöó Tesla Recall Alert! Are self-driving cars safe? 13,000 models affected..." | Skip Instagram (cars don't perform well) |
| **Real Estate Market** | "üè† Housing Market Crash? New data shows existing home sales dropping 5%..." | "Are you waiting for the right time to buy? The market is shifting and you might have more power than you think..." |
| **Owner Financing** | "üí∞ Skip the Bank! Owner financing is changing how Americans buy homes. New laws in Texas..." | "This is how I bought my house with a 550 credit score. Banks said no 3 times. Owner financing said yes..." |
| **Car Pricing** | "‚ö°Ô∏è EV Prices Dropping Fast! Nissan LEAF now under $30k but dealers are hiding the real wholesale prices..." | Skip Instagram |
| **Bad Credit Solutions** | "üö® Credit Score Myths Exposed! You CAN buy a home with bad credit - here's the secret banks don't tell you..." | "Rejected by every lender? I was too. Here's how I became a homeowner anyway with owner financing..." |

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### System Changes Needed:

#### 1. Create Platform-Specific Video Variants

**File**: `src/lib/video-platform-optimizer.ts`

```typescript
interface PlatformVideoConfig {
  youtube: {
    hookStyle: 'shocking' | 'news' | 'controversial';
    textOverlayStyle: 'emoji-headline';
    pacing: 'fast';
    angle: 'news';
  };
  instagram: {
    hookStyle: 'personal' | 'pain-point';
    textOverlayStyle: 'personal-statement';
    pacing: 'moderate';
    angle: 'story';
  };
}

// This would integrate with your video generation system
export async function generatePlatformVideoVariants(
  baseVideoUrl: string,
  topic: string,
  brand: string
): Promise<{ youtube: string; instagram: string }> {
  // Use video editing API (or flag for HeyGen/Submagic) to create variants

  // YouTube variant: Fast cuts, news angle, emoji text overlay
  const youtubeVariant = await createYouTubeVariant(baseVideoUrl, {
    hookType: 'shocking',
    textOverlay: getYouTubeTextOverlay(topic),
    pacing: 'fast'
  });

  // Instagram variant: Personal story, slower pacing
  const instagramVariant = await createInstagramVariant(baseVideoUrl, {
    hookType: 'personal',
    textOverlay: getInstagramTextOverlay(topic),
    pacing: 'moderate'
  });

  return {
    youtube: youtubeVariant,
    instagram: instagramVariant
  };
}
```

#### 2. Platform-Specific Caption Generation

**File**: `src/lib/platform-caption-generator.ts`

```typescript
export async function generateYouTubeCaptionOptimized(
  script: string,
  topic: string
): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `
Generate a YouTube caption optimized for maximum views.

Script: ${script}
Topic: ${topic}

REQUIREMENTS (based on top YouTube posts analysis):
- Length: 200-300 characters (STRICT)
- Include relevant emoji (üöó ‚ö°Ô∏è üè† üö®)
- Include exclamation marks (2-3)
- Include question to hook viewers
- Include hashtags (3-5)
- Angle: News/announcement style
- Tone: Exciting, urgent, newsworthy

FORMAT:
[Emoji] [SHOCKING HEADLINE]!

[Hook Question]

[News-angle explanation with stats/specifics]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.7
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content || script;
}

export async function generateInstagramCaptionOptimized(
  script: string,
  topic: string
): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `
Generate an Instagram caption optimized for maximum engagement.

Script: ${script}
Topic: ${topic}

REQUIREMENTS (based on top Instagram posts analysis):
- Length: 200-300 characters (STRICT)
- NO emoji needed (only 20% of top posts use them)
- Include exclamation marks (1-2)
- Include question (55% of top posts)
- HASHTAGS REQUIRED (100% of top posts use them)
- Angle: Personal story or pain point
- Tone: Relatable, personal, solution-focused

FORMAT (choose one):

OPTION 1 - Personal Story:
[Achievement statement] [Story with specific numbers like credit score, income] #homeowner #rent #badcredit #ownerfinance #realestate

OPTION 2 - Pain Point:
[Pain point question] [Solution explanation with specifics] #homeowner #rent #badcredit #ownerfinance #realestate
`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.7
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content || script;
}
```

#### 3. Platform Selection Based on Topic

```typescript
export function getPlatformsForTopic(topic: string, brand: string): string[] {
  const topicLower = topic.toLowerCase();

  // Car/EV topics = YouTube only
  if (
    topicLower.includes('car') ||
    topicLower.includes('ev') ||
    topicLower.includes('electric') ||
    topicLower.includes('tesla') ||
    topicLower.includes('vehicle')
  ) {
    return ['youtube']; // Instagram doesn't work for car content
  }

  // Real estate topics = Both platforms
  if (
    topicLower.includes('home') ||
    topicLower.includes('house') ||
    topicLower.includes('real estate') ||
    topicLower.includes('rent') ||
    topicLower.includes('owner financ') ||
    topicLower.includes('credit')
  ) {
    return ['youtube', 'instagram']; // Both platforms work
  }

  // Default: both platforms
  return ['youtube', 'instagram'];
}
```
