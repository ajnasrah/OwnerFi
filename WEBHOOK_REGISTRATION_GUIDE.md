# HeyGen Webhook Registration Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

This guide walks you through registering your brand-specific webhooks with HeyGen's API.

---

## Prerequisites

1. ‚úÖ Deploy your app with the new brand-specific webhook endpoints
2. ‚úÖ Have your `HEYGEN_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
3. ‚úÖ Ensure your webhook endpoints are publicly accessible and respond to OPTIONS requests

---

## Step 1: List Existing Webhooks (Optional)

First, check what webhooks are currently registered:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-heygen-webhooks.mjs
```

This will show you all registered webhooks. You might see an old shared webhook like:
- `https://ownerfi.ai/api/webhooks/heygen`

---

## Step 2: Delete Old Shared Webhook (Recommended)

If you have an old shared webhook, delete it before registering new ones:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-heygen-webhooks.mjs --delete-shared
```

Or delete all webhooks:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-heygen-webhooks.mjs --delete-all
```

Or delete a specific webhook by ID:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-heygen-webhooks.mjs --delete-id=<endpoint_id>
```

---

## Step 3: Register Brand-Specific Webhooks

Run the registration script:

```bash
node scripts/register-heygen-webhooks.mjs
```

This will:
1. Check for existing webhooks
2. Register 3 new brand-specific webhooks:
   - `https://ownerfi.ai/api/webhooks/heygen/carz`
   - `https://ownerfi.ai/api/webhooks/heygen/ownerfi`
   - `https://ownerfi.ai/api/webhooks/heygen/podcast`
3. Save webhook secrets to `heygen-webhook-secrets.json`
4. Display environment variables to add

---

## Step 4: Add Webhook Secrets to Environment

The script will output environment variables like:

```bash
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CARZ=abc123...
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_OWNERFI=def456...
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PODCAST=ghi789...
```

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# HeyGen Webhook Secrets
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CARZ=abc123...
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_OWNERFI=def456...
HEYGEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PODCAST=ghi789...
```

---

## Step 5: Deploy Your Application

Redeploy your application to Vercel/production so the new environment variables are available:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Or commit and push to trigger automatic deployment.

---

## Step 6: Test Each Brand

Test that each brand's webhook works:

### Test Carz
```bash
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/workflow/complete-viral \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "carz",
    "platforms": ["instagram", "tiktok"],
    "schedule": "immediate"
  }'
```

### Test OwnerFi
```bash
curl -X POST https://ownerfi.ai/api/workflow/complete-viral \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "ownerfi",
    "platforms": ["instagram", "tiktok"],
    "schedule": "immediate"
  }'
```

### Test Podcast
Podcast generation is triggered by cron. You can manually trigger it:

```bash
curl -X GET https://ownerfi.ai/api/podcast/cron?force=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

---

## Verification

After registering, verify webhooks are working:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for webhook signature verification messages
2. **Check DLQ**: Ensure no webhook failures are logged
3. **Check Workflows**: Verify videos complete successfully

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Registration Fails

**Error**: "Failed to download video: 401"
- **Cause**: HeyGen can't reach your webhook endpoint
- **Solution**: Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible and responds to OPTIONS requests

**Error**: "Webhook endpoint validation failed"
- **Cause**: Your server didn't respond to OPTIONS within 1 second
- **Solution**: Check that your OPTIONS handler is fast (no DB queries)

### Webhook Signature Verification Fails

**Error**: "Webhook verification failed: Invalid webhook signature"
- **Cause**: Webhook secret doesn't match or request was tampered with
- **Solution**:
  1. Check that environment variables are correct
  2. Redeploy application
  3. Re-register webhooks if needed

### Webhook Not Receiving Requests

**Symptom**: Videos generate but webhook is never called
- **Cause**: Webhook URL not registered or incorrect
- **Solution**:
  1. Run `node scripts/cleanup-heygen-webhooks.mjs` to list webhooks
  2. Verify URLs are correct
  3. Re-register if needed

---

## Advanced Usage

### Bypass Signature Verification (Development Only)

For local testing, you can bypass signature verification:

```bash
# .env.local
NODE_ENV=development
DISABLE_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION=true
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never use this in production!**

### Manual Webhook Registration via cURL

If the script doesn't work, you can register manually:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.heygen.com/v1/webhook/endpoint.add' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_HEYGEN_API_KEY' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://ownerfi.ai/api/webhooks/heygen/carz",
    "events": ["avatar_video.success", "avatar_video.fail"]
  }'
```

### Check Webhook Status

List all registered webhooks:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.heygen.com/v1/webhook/endpoint.list' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_HEYGEN_API_KEY'
```

### Delete a Webhook

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.heygen.com/v1/webhook/endpoint.delete' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: YOUR_HEYGEN_API_KEY' \
  --data '{
    "endpoint_id": "YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID"
  }'
```

## Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Always use webhook signature verification in production
2. ‚úÖ Store webhook secrets in environment variables (never commit to git)
3. ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints
5. ‚úÖ Log all webhook failures to DLQ for investigation
6. ‚úÖ Monitor webhook health regularly

---

## Next Steps

After webhook registration:

1. [ ] Test brand isolation (Carz failure doesn't affect OwnerFi)
2. [ ] Monitor DLQ for any failures
3. [ ] Set up alerting for webhook failures
4. [ ] Create admin dashboard for webhook management
5. [ ] Document any brand-specific webhook behaviors
