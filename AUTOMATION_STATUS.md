# üîß Property Video Queue Automation - CURRENT STATUS

## ‚úÖ Automation is LIVE and WORKING

The auto-queue code has been added to the GHL webhook and is now active.

### Recent Test Results

**Latest properties from GoHighLevel:**

1. ‚úÖ **8236 Linden Dr** (Prairie Village, KS)
   - Created: 10/30/2025, 3:29 PM
   - Status: IN VIDEO QUEUE (queued)
   - **AUTO-ADDED SUCCESSFULLY**

2. ‚úÖ **9323 Bee Balm Ave** (Odessa, TX)
   - Created: 10/30/2025, 3:15 PM
   - Status: IN VIDEO QUEUE (queued)
   - **AUTO-ADDED SUCCESSFULLY**

3. ‚úÖ **348 Alhambra Pl** (West Palm Beach, FL)
   - Created: 10/30/2025, 2:53 PM
   - Status: IN VIDEO QUEUE (queued)
   - **AUTO-ADDED SUCCESSFULLY**

### Properties That Require Manual Intervention

The following properties came through BEFORE the automation was implemented and are NOT in the queue:

1. ‚ùå **1226 Billings** (San Antonio, TX)
   - Created: 10/30/2025, 2:36 PM
   - Meets all criteria (active, has images)
   - Needs manual add to queue

2. ‚ùå **2225 N Woody St** (Edinburg, TX)
   - Created: 10/30/2025, 2:33 PM
   - Meets all criteria (active, has images)
   - Needs manual add to queue

### How the Automation Works

**Code Location**: `/src/app/api/gohighlevel/webhook/save-property/route.ts` (lines 662-687)

**Logic**:
```
When property is saved from GHL webhook:
  IF status === 'active'
  AND isActive === true
  AND has at least 1 image
  THEN automatically add to video queue
```

**The automation calls**: `POST /api/property/add-to-queue` with the propertyId

### Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Automation is working - no action needed for future properties
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 older properties need manual queue addition (awaiting user decision)

### Verification

To verify automation is working, check server logs for this message when new properties come from GHL:
```
üé• Auto-adding property {propertyId} to video queue
```
