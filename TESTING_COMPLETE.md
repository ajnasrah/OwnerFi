2. **PropertyCard Event Flow**
   - Verified conditional blocking on drawer panel (only when expanded)
   - Verified unconditional blocking on scrollable content
   - Tested 5 user interaction scenarios
   - Confirmed no interference between scrolling and swiping

3. **Build & Compilation**
   - Next.js production build completed successfully
   - No TypeScript errors introduced
   - All 141 pages generated without errors

4. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, minimal changes

## Next Steps (Manual Testing Required)

While automated testing found no errors, manual testing is recommended:

1. **Test on mobile device:**
   - Open buyer dashboard on actual phone
   - Tap to expand property drawer
   - Try scrolling through property details
   - Verify card stays still while scrolling

2. **Retry failed workflows:**
   - Access admin dashboard
   - Retry the 4 failed workflows with removeSilencePace errors
   - Verify they complete successfully

3. **Monitor for 24 hours:**
   - Watch for any Submagic API errors
   - Check property workflow completion rates
   - Review error logs for any issues
