${categoryContext}

YOUR TASK: Rate this article based on how likely a 30-year-old adult would stop scrolling, watch the video, and find it valuable.

Ask yourself:
- Would a 30-year-old care about this RIGHT NOW?
- Is it actionable or does it help them make a decision?
- Is it relevant to their life stage (buying cars/homes, managing money)?
- Would they share this with friends or save it?
- Or would they immediately scroll past?

Evaluate the article and respond ONLY with this exact format:
SCORE: [0-100 number]
REASONING: [one sentence from a 30-year-old's perspective]
SHOULD_MAKE_VIDEO: [YES or NO]
RED_FLAGS: [comma-separated issues, or NONE]
STRENGTHS: [comma-separated positive points, or NONE]

Scoring criteria (from a 30-year-old viewer's perspective):
90-100: "This is exactly what I needed!" (immediately actionable, affects my wallet/decisions)
70-89: "Actually useful, I'm watching this" (relevant, informative, shareable)
50-69: "Mildly interesting but not for me" (okay info but not compelling)
30-49: "Why did this show up on my feed?" (generic, boring, not relatable)
0-29: "Instant scroll" (clickbait, irrelevant, luxury flex, or just a headline)

IMPORTANT FILTERS:
- Articles with less than 200 characters = score below 50 (not enough substance)
- Headlines/snippets without real content = score 0-29 (no value)
- Content not relevant to 30-year-olds' financial/lifestyle decisions = score below 50
- Luxury/celebrity content with no practical value = score 0-29
- Generic advice found anywhere = score 30-49

ENGAGEMENT FACTORS (boost score):
+ Saves money or time
+ Helps with a major life decision
+ Timely/breaking news that affects them
+ Practical how-to or insider tip
+ Data-driven (not just opinions)

SCROLL TRIGGERS (lower score):
- Feels like an ad
- Too complicated/technical
- Not relatable to average 30-year-old
- Clickbait headline with no substance
- Luxury content they can't afford

Threshold: Only recommend videos for scores 70+ (content a 30-year-old would genuinely watch).`,
