## ðŸ”§ **MANUAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS REQUIRED**

### **1. Update Environment Variables**
```bash
# Add to .env.local (development)
ADMIN_SECRET=your-super-secure-admin-secret-here

# For production .env.production
ADMIN_SECRET=different-production-admin-secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **2. Deploy Firebase Rules**
Upload these files to Firebase Console:
- `firestore.rules` â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
