# Platform-Specific Analytics Strategy
## Optimizing Engagement & Viewer Retention Through Data-Driven Posting

**Goal**: Maximize engagement and viewer retention by analyzing platform-specific performance patterns and dynamically adjusting posting schedules and content strategies.

---

## 1. ANALYTICS DATA STRUCTURE (Late API Insights)

Based on Late.dev documentation, the analytics endpoint provides:

### Available Metrics Per Platform:
- **Views**: Total video views
- **Likes**: User likes/reactions
- **Comments**: Comment count
- **Shares**: Share/repost count
- **Saves**: Bookmark/save count
- **Reach**: Unique users reached
- **Impressions**: Total times content was displayed
- **Engagement Rate**: (likes + comments + shares) / views * 100
- **Viewer Retention**: Watch time / video length (when available)

### Query Parameters:
- `platform`: Filter by specific platform (instagram, tiktok, youtube, facebook, linkedin, twitter, threads, pinterest, reddit, bluesky)
- `profileId`: Filter by brand profile
- `fromDate/toDate`: Date range analysis
- `sortBy`: Sort by date or engagement
- `limit/page`: Pagination for large datasets

### Rate Limit:
- **30 requests per hour** - Must cache and batch requests intelligently

## 3. DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Historical Data Sync (One-time)
```typescript
// Sync last 90 days of data for all brands
// Store in Firestore: platform_analytics collection
{
  postId: string,
  brand: string,
  platform: string,
  publishedAt: timestamp,
  metrics: {
    views: number,
    likes: number,
    comments: number,
    shares: number,
    saves: number,
    reach: number,
    impressions: number,
    engagementRate: number
  },
  metadata: {
    timeSlot: string,        // "07:00-08:00"
    dayOfWeek: string,       // "Monday"
    hour: number,            // 7
    contentType: string,     // "viral", "benefit", "property"
    variant: string,         // "15sec", "30sec"
    hook: string,
    hookType: string,
    caption: string
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Daily Sync (Automated)
- **Cron Job**: 6 AM daily (before first post)
- **Process**:
  1. Fetch yesterday's posts from Late API
  2. For each platform, update metrics
  3. Calculate performance scores
  4. Update platform trend indicators
  5. Generate recommendations for today's posting

### Phase 3: Real-time Monitoring (Optional Enhancement)
- Track first-hour performance for early virality detection
- Auto-boost high-performing content (consider paid promotion)
- Alert on underperforming patterns

---

## 4. PERFORMANCE SCORING SYSTEM

### Engagement Score (0-100)
```
Base Score = (
  (views / avg_platform_views) * 30 +
  (likes / views) * 100 * 20 +
  (comments / views) * 100 * 25 +
  (shares / views) * 100 * 15 +
  (saves / views) * 100 * 10
)

Platform Multiplier:
- Instagram: saves weight = 15, comments = 20
- TikTok: shares weight = 25, views = 35
- YouTube: watch time weight = 40
- LinkedIn: comments = 30, shares = 20
- Twitter: retweets = 30, impressions = 25
```

### Retention Score (0-100)
```
Retention Score = (
  (avg_watch_time / video_length) * 100
)

Excellent: 80-100 (viral potential)
Good: 60-79 (solid content)
Average: 40-59 (needs optimization)
Poor: 0-39 (hook/content issues)
```

---

## 5. AUTOMATED QUEUE OPTIMIZATION

### Current Queue System
```typescript
// Each brand has queue slots configured:
{
  dayOfWeek: 1-7,
  time: "HH:mm",
  timezone: "America/New_York"
}
```

### New: Platform-Specific Queue Optimization

**Algorithm**:
1. **Weekly Analysis** (Every Sunday 11 PM):
   - Analyze last 7 days performance per platform
   - Calculate optimal posting times by platform
   - Identify underperforming time slots
   - Generate new queue configuration

2. **Platform Peak Times Detection**:
   ```typescript
   interface PlatformPeakTimes {
     platform: string;
     peakSlots: Array<{
       dayOfWeek: number;
       hour: number;
       avgEngagement: number;
       avgViews: number;
       confidenceScore: number; // Based on sample size
     }>;
     avoidSlots: Array<{
       dayOfWeek: number;
       hour: number;
       reason: string;
     }>;
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Slot Allocation**:
   - **Instagram**: 2-3 posts/day at peak times
   - **TikTok**: 3-5 posts/day (favors frequency)
   - **YouTube**: 1-2 posts/day (quality over quantity)
   - **LinkedIn**: 1 post/day on business days
   - **Twitter**: 2-4 posts/day (high velocity)
   - **Facebook**: 1-2 posts/day
   - **Threads**: 1-2 posts/day

4. **Content Type Matching**:
   ```typescript
   // Route content types to best-performing platforms
   viral_content -> [tiktok, instagram, youtube]
   benefit_content -> [instagram, facebook, linkedin]
   property_content -> [instagram, facebook, linkedin]
   educational -> [youtube, linkedin, twitter]
   ```

## 10. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### API Rate Limit Management
```typescript
class LateAnalyticsClient {
  private requestCount = 0;
  private requestWindow = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
  private maxRequests = 30;

  async fetchWithRateLimit(url: string) {
    if (this.requestCount >= this.maxRequests) {
      // Wait for window reset
      await this.waitForReset();
    }

    this.requestCount++;
    return fetch(url);
  }

  // Batch multiple profile/platform queries
  async fetchBatch(queries: Query[]) {
    // Optimize to use fewer API calls
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Cache analytics data for 6 hours
// Update only when new posts or 6+ hours passed
const CACHE_TTL = 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

interface CachedAnalytics {
  platform: string;
  metrics: PlatformMetrics;
  fetchedAt: number;
  ttl: number;
}
```

### Data Freshness
