  // etc...
};
const today = days[new Date().getDay()];
const todayTheme = dailyThemes[today];
```

## 🎯 CHATGPT PROMPT SYSTEM

### System Message
```
You are the official social-media scriptwriter for OwnerFi, a platform
that helps people become homeowners without traditional banks using
owner financing.

Your only job: Create short, 30-second max (≈90-word) video scripts
that explain, inspire, and educate buyers who think homeownership
is out of reach.

GOAL: Make everyday renters stop scrolling and realize — they can
actually own a home through owner financing.

STYLE: Friendly, confident, motivational — like a big brother giving
real talk. 5th-grade reading level. No hype, no jargon. Always end
with "See what's possible at OwnerFi.ai" or similar.

NEVER promise approvals, prices, or guarantees. All content must be
100% original and copyright-safe.
```

### Script Structure
Every script follows:
```
🎯 Hook (3-5 seconds) - Shock/surprise/emotion
💡 Main message (15-20 seconds) - Insight/story
🏁 Soft CTA (5 seconds) - OwnerFi.ai mention
```

### Example Output
```
🎯 "Think you need perfect credit to buy a home? Nope — that's the old way."
💡 "With owner financing, you can buy directly from the seller. No bank
hoops, no long waits, just steady income and a down payment. It's how
thousands of families finally got keys in their hands."
🏁 "Search owner-finance homes near you — free at OwnerFi.ai."
```

## 🚀 PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Daily Automation (5 Videos)

```typescript
// 1. Check if videos needed
const { shouldGenerate, videosNeeded } = scheduler.shouldGenerateVideos();

if (shouldGenerate) {
  // 2. Get recent benefit IDs (avoid repetition)
  const recentIds = scheduler.getRecentBenefitIds();

  // 3. Generate videos
  for (let i = 0; i < videosNeeded; i++) {
    // Get random buyer benefit (not recently used)
    const benefit = getRandomBenefit('buyer', recentIds);

    // Generate script with ChatGPT (uses daily theme)
    const script = await generator.generateScript(benefit);

    // Generate video with HeyGen
    const videoId = await generator.generateBenefitVideo(benefit, workflowId);

    // Record in scheduler
    await scheduler.recordBenefitVideo(benefit.id, workflowId);
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

**Current:**
- ✅ Script generation with ChatGPT
- ✅ Video generation with HeyGen
- ✅ Daily scheduling via cron

### DON'T:

❌ Use trademarked phrases
❌ Copy content from other sources

## 🔒 BUYER-ONLY ENFORCEMENT

### How It Works

**Script Generator:**
```typescript
if (benefit.audience !== 'buyer') {
  throw new Error('This system is BUYER-ONLY. Seller benefits are not supported.');
}
```

**Scheduler:**
```typescript
interface BenefitVideoRecord {
  benefit_id: string;
  audience: 'buyer'; // BUYER-ONLY - type enforced
  // ...
}
```

**Result:**
- Any attempt to use seller benefits = immediate error
- Type system enforces buyer-only at compile time
- Runtime checks ensure no seller content leaks through

---

## 📊 MONITORING & METRICS

### Scheduler Stats

```typescript
scheduler.getStats()
// Returns:
{
  total_videos: 150,
  buyer_videos: 150,  // All are buyer videos
  published_videos: 140,
  recent_buyer_benefits: ['buyer_1', 'buyer_2', ...],
  schedule_enabled: true,
  videos_per_day: 5,
  next_scheduled: "Immediately (need 3 buyer videos)"
}
```

### Success Metrics to Track

## 🎯 EXAMPLE SCRIPTS BY DAY

### Monday (Credit Myths)
```
"Bad credit? So what. Most people don't know that owner financing
doesn't care about your credit score like banks do. What matters is
steady income and commitment. Stop letting a number stop you from
homeownership. Find homes that work with YOUR situation at OwnerFi.ai."
```

### Tuesday (Real Stories)
```
"Meet Sarah. Denied by 5 banks. Owned her home in 3 weeks through
owner financing. She had steady income but medical debt tanked her
credit. The seller saw her commitment, not her score. Now she's
building equity every month. See stories like Sarah's at OwnerFi.ai."
```

### Wednesday (How It Works)
```
"Here's how owner financing works: You buy directly from the seller.
They become your bank. You make monthly payments to them, not Chase
or Wells Fargo. They hold the deed until you pay it off. Simple. Fast.
Flexible. Search homes today at OwnerFi.ai."
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Script too long
**Solution:** AI targets 90 words. If consistently over, adjust temperature from 0.85 to 0.75

### Issue: Script not engaging
**Solution:** Verify daily theme is applying. Check benefit description quality.

### Issue: "BUYER-ONLY" error
**Solution:** ✅ This is intentional! System is rejecting seller benefits as designed.

### Issue: No videos generated
**Solution:** Check `shouldGenerateVideos()` - may have already hit daily limit (5)

### Issue: OpenAI API error
**Solution:** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and has credits. Fallback script will be used.

## 📈 SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Capacity
- **5 videos/day** = 35 videos/week = 150 videos/month
- **10 unique benefits** = each benefit used ~15x per month
- **Daily themes** = fresh angles prevent repetition

### To Scale Further

**Option 1: Add More Benefits**
- Expand content library from 10 to 20+ buyer benefits
- Add seasonal/trending topics
- Create regional-specific benefits

**Option 2: Increase Daily Output**
- Change `videos_per_day` from 5 to 10
- Requires more benefit variations
- May need stronger anti-repetition logic

**Option 3: Multi-Platform**
- Same 5 videos, different platforms
- TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
- Same script, different avatars/styles
