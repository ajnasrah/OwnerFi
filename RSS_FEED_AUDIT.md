- Autoblog, Automotive News, Car and Driver, Edmunds, InsideEVs, Jalopnik, Motor1, MotorTrend, The Verge, Charged EVs, EV Central

---

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. Article Age Filter
- **Before:** 3 days (too restrictive)
- **After:** 30 days (allows more content selection)
- **File:** `src/lib/feed-store-firestore.ts:263`

### 2. Feed Configuration Cleanup
- **Before:** 27 feeds (many broken/empty)
- **After:** 10 feeds (all verified working)
- **Breakdown:**
  - VassDistro: 5 feeds (all excellent)
  - OwnerFi: 4 feeds (all excellent)
  - Carz: 1 feed (adequate)

### 3. Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to `getAndLockArticle()` to show:
  - Number of unprocessed articles found
  - Quality scores of articles
  - Filtering results (why articles are rejected)

---

## üìà Quality Standards

### EXCELLENT (Most feeds)
- Content length: 1000+ characters
- Full article content included in RSS
- Regular updates (10+ articles/day)
- ‚úÖ **All VassDistro and OwnerFi feeds meet this standard**

### ADEQUATE (Carz)
- Content length: 500-1000 characters
- Partial content or summaries
- Sufficient for video script generation

### POOR/FAIL (Removed)
- Content length: < 200 characters or no content
- Headlines only
- Empty feeds or broken URLs

---

## üöÄ How The System Works

### Daily Automated Workflow

**12:00 PM** - RSS Fetch Cron (`/api/cron/fetch-rss`)
- Fetches new articles from all 10 feeds
- Saves to Firestore (brand-specific collections)
- Only stores articles published after last fetch (no duplicates)

**1:00 PM** - Article Rating Cron (`/api/cron/rate-articles`)
- Rates all new unprocessed articles with AI (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
- Quality scores: 0-100 (only 70+ are used for videos)
- Keeps top 20 articles per brand, deletes low-quality ones

**10:00 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM** - Video Generation Crons
- `generate-video` (Carz/OwnerFi): Selects top-rated article, creates video
- `generate-video-vassdistro` (VassDistro): Runs separately at 10 AM

### Article Selection Logic (`getAndLockArticle`)

Articles must meet ALL criteria:
1. ‚úÖ `processed: false` (not already used)
2. ‚úÖ `qualityScore >= 70` (AI-rated as video-worthy)
3. ‚úÖ `pubDate within 30 days` (recent content)
4. ‚úÖ Atomically locked (prevents race conditions)

## ‚úÖ Verification Tests

All systems tested and working:

```bash
# Test RSS fetching
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-all-feeds"

# Test article rating
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/rate-articles"

# Test workflow for each brand
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/workflow/complete-viral" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"brand":"vassdistro","platforms":["instagram","tiktok"],"schedule":"immediate"}'
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ VassDistro: Working perfectly
- ‚úÖ OwnerFi: Articles fetching (avatar ID needs update)
- ‚úÖ Carz: Articles fetching (avatar ID needs update)

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. `src/lib/feed-store-firestore.ts` - Extended age filter, added logging
2. `src/config/feed-sources.ts` - Cleaned feeds (27 ‚Üí 10)
3. `src/app/api/test-rss/route.ts` - NEW: Test individual feeds
4. `src/app/api/test-all-feeds/route.ts` - NEW: Test all feeds comprehensively

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Add more Carz feeds** - Research alternative automotive RSS sources
2. **Monitor feed health** - Create dashboard showing feed status
3. **A/B test article quality thresholds** - Test if 60+ score works as well as 70+
4. **Fetch frequency optimization** - Adjust fetchInterval based on feed update patterns

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No articles available" error

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check articles in database
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-rss?brand=vassdistro"

# Check debug logs in getAndLockArticle
# Logs show: articles found ‚Üí quality scores ‚Üí filtering results
```

**Common causes:**
1. All articles are processed (marked as used)
2. Articles are too old (>30 days)
3. No articles have quality score >= 70
4. RSS feeds haven't fetched yet (run `/api/cron/fetch-rss`)

**Solution:**
1. Trigger RSS fetch: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-rss`
2. Rate articles: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/cron/rate-articles`
3. Try workflow again
