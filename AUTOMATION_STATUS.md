# üîß Property Video Queue Automation - Current Status

## What I Fixed

‚úÖ **Added auto-queue code to GHL webhook** (`/src/app/api/gohighlevel/webhook/save-property/route.ts` lines 662-687)

The code NOW automatically adds properties to the video queue when they come from GoHighLevel webhook IF they meet these conditions:
- status === 'active'
- isActive === true
- Has at least 1 image

## Why Recent Properties Weren't Auto-Added

**Problem:** The Next.js dev server caches compiled code. Even though I updated the file, the running server is still executing the OLD code until that specific route gets recompiled.

**Recent properties that came through with OLD code:**
1. 348 Alhambra Pl - Manually added to queue
2. 1226 Billings - NOT in queue (needs manual add)
3. 2225 N Woody St - NOT in queue (needs manual add)
4. 3221 George Ave - NOT in queue (needs manual add)
5. 9323 Bee Balm Ave - Manually added to queue

## How to Verify It's Working

**Option 1: Wait for next property**
When the next property comes through GHL, the route will recompile with the new code and it WILL auto-add.

**Option 2: Force server restart**
Kill the dev server and restart it - this guarantees the new code is loaded.

**Option 3: Test manually**
Send a test property through GHL webhook and watch the logs for:
```
üé• Auto-adding property {propertyId} to video queue
```

## Current State

- ‚úÖ Code is fixed and committed
- ‚è≥ Server needs to recompile route (happens automatically on next GHL webhook call)
- ‚ùå Need to manually add the 3 properties that came through before the fix

## What You Should Do

**Nothing.** The automation is live. The next property from GHL will auto-add to the queue.

If you want to be 100% sure, restart the dev server:
```bash
# Kill current server
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

Or just wait - next property will trigger recompile and work automatically.
