# VassDistro Queue Fixed in getlate.dev ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** RESOLVED

---

## üêõ Problem

VassDistro queue was not configured in getlate.dev, causing VassDistro videos to fail posting or post immediately instead of using the optimized B2B schedule.

---

## üîç Root Cause

The `scripts/setup-late-queues.ts` script was missing VassDistro configuration:
- Only configured queues for OwnerFi, Carz, and Podcast
- VassDistro was added to the system but queue setup was never implemented
- Environment variable `LATE_VASSDISTRO_PROFILE_ID` existed but was unused in setup script

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added VassDistro Queue Configuration

Created B2B-optimized posting schedule matching the cron schedule:

```typescript
const VASSDISTRO_QUEUE = {
  timezone: 'America/New_York',
  slots: [
    // Weekdays: 5 posts per day (8 AM, 11 AM, 2 PM, 5 PM, 8 PM)
    { dayOfWeek: 1-5, time: '08:00' }, // Morning commute
    { dayOfWeek: 1-5, time: '11:00' }, // Mid-morning break
    { dayOfWeek: 1-5, time: '14:00' }, // Lunch hour
    { dayOfWeek: 1-5, time: '17:00' }, // End of day
    { dayOfWeek: 1-5, time: '20:00' }, // Evening research

    // Weekends: 3 posts per day (10 AM, 2 PM, 7 PM)
    { dayOfWeek: 0,6, time: '10:00' },
    { dayOfWeek: 0,6, time: '14:00' },
    { dayOfWeek: 0,6, time: '19:00' },
  ]
};
```

**Total:** 31 posting slots per week (25 weekday + 6 weekend)

### 2. Updated Setup Script

**File:** `scripts/setup-late-queues.ts`

Changes made:
- ‚úÖ Added `VASSDISTRO_QUEUE` configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `setupQueue()` function signature to include `'vassdistro'`
- ‚úÖ Updated `viewCurrentQueues()` to check VassDistro
- ‚úÖ Updated `main()` to configure VassDistro queue
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable check for `LATE_VASSDISTRO_PROFILE_ID`
- ‚úÖ Updated success message: "All 4 queues" instead of "All 3 queues"

### 3. Deployed Queue to getlate.dev

Ran setup script successfully:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-late-queues.ts
```

**Result:**
```
‚úÖ All 4 queues configured successfully!
   Note: OwnerFi queue handles viral videos, benefit videos, AND property videos
```
